Oh my Clematis

Hope that bloomed with darkness nigh

Oh my Clematis

Stay forever by my side


You bloomed from the abyss

Climbing walls to reach the sky

See the universe shine

And the starlight in your eyes

When the darkness blinds my sight

I will find you by your scent

If I slumber forevermore

Tell me you won’t leave my world


Oh my clematis

Hope that bloomed with darkness nigh

Oh my Clematis


Stay forever by my side


Do you believe in God?


Once upon a time, mankind had religion

and believed in God.

They believed that which could not be

solved by human strength,

was the Will of God.

Believed that the entire universe

revolved around the Earth.

They thought that unreachable place

that connected with the sky was...

where the gods lived.

From the moment

humanity left the universe,

we all forgot about God.

But if belief in god is human

If all I can do as a human

is to believe….

My god...

My universe...

Oh my Clematis

Withered hopes and darkness nigh

Oh my Clematis

Can’t you stay here by my side…?



My dear clematis
